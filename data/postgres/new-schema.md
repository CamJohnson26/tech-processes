# Create new schema
* List your app's entities
* List the rules that constrain them
* List ways they can be changed
* List the ways they can be grouped, filtered, and sorted
* Referencing these results, generate a Mermaid ER diagram with proposed schema
* Validate the schema matches requirements, and save in documentation
* Run through `new-table.md` for all the tables
