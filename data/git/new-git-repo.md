# Setting up a new Git Repo
* Find the name you want

```
cd ~/Git/Personal
gh repo create
```
* Say no to gitignore and readme, JS and TS aren't supported
* On Github, create the "Main" branch, change it to default on Settings > General
* Open the repo folder in Sublime Merge, checkout main
* Got an issue cloning the repo, think it's some issue with my rsa keys since github rotated their keys.
